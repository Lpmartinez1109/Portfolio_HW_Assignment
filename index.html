        <p style="line-height: 25px; margin-left: 30px;">My name is Luis Martinez. I was born and read here in Chicago, Illinois. I am the oldest of four children and the first in my family to attend college. I graduated from Eastern Illinois University in 2016 with a bachelor's degree in journalism. After I spent a few years working as a data entry specialist for Grubhub, I decided that it was time to look for a new career path.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 25px; margin-left: 30px;">I am a huge fan of the Chicago Bears and WWE. I started watching WWE as a child and have grown up with wrestling as a huge part of my life. My family has always been a fan of the Chicago Bears, and I consider players such as Walter Payton and Brian Urlacher as some of the best men to ever play the sport.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 25px; margin-left: 30px;"> I am a huge fan of the Marvel films, including the Avengers films as I had spent most of my early years growing up watching every single film since the first Iron Man film back in 2008. I also love to read and write on my spare time. I am a huge fan of Stephen King and recently finshed reading Docter Sleep. Whenever I'm not too busy, I like to play some video games on my PS4 as well.
