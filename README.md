# Portfolio Assignment

So for this assignment, I first started with creating the files, index.html; portfolio.html and contact.html
Next I created an Asset folder with two sub folder inside titled css and images.

#First Steps

I started working on the indext.html file since once that was working it would be easy to use the same formatting to work on the other two files.

Once the inital code was typed up, I started to work on the style.css page, but ran in a few problems early on.
